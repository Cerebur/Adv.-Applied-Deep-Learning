def collate_fn_transformer(batch):
    """
    Custom function that defines how batches are formed.

    To process the batch items that each have a different number of hits, it is efficient
    to first concatenate all the data into a single tensor and save the lengths of each
    individual event to be able to split the data again later.

    # F: input_dim, number of features (time, x, y)
    # N: number of hits (different for each event)
    # B: batch size

    The resulting 2D tensor has the shape (B x N, F) where B is the batch size, N is the total number of hits of all events
    in the batch, and F is the number of features (time, x, y).


    Parameters
    ----------
    batch : list
        A list of dictionaries containing the data and labels for each graph.
        The data is available in the "data" key and the labels are in the "xpos" and "ypos" keys.
    Returns
    -------
    packed_data : Batch
        A batch of graph data objects.
    labels : torch.Tensor
        A tensor containing the labels for each graph.
